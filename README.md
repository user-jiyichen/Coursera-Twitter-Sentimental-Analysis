# Coursera-Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
An guided project on sentimental analysis on COVID-19 tweets using python. I used a dataset consisting of data related to the tweets from 24th of July 2020 to the 30th of August 2020 with covid19 hashtags.
The tweets are labeled into 3 emotional categories: Positive, Neutral and Negative.

The certificate can be found via the [Coursera page](coursera.org/verify/TRB5R4SHJ9H7)
